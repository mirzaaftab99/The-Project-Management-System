This project is made to suit student projects management system, that includes various
projects assigned to students and the students working on each project. This software system
allows for easy project management and tracking activities in those projects.

The software is inclusive of four special designated logins, each of them performing their
own special and dignified role. They include HOD Login, Guide Login, Project Co-ordinator
Login and last but not the least, the Student Group Leader Login. All these logins collectively
work in the software as a social unit.
An administrator has the overall control of this system that allows him to create and remove
projects as per the requirement, allocate guides for those projects and also allocate the
specified students to work on those projects and also be able to track the project progress.
